## About
This application will allow the user to manage their time using a 15-3-10 (minutes) Pomodoro format. This will divide the time spent working into easy to manage intervals and increase overall productivity.

## Inspiration
I wrote this application to gain experience with GUI design, and to solve the problem of overworking myself without taking necessary breaks to collect my thoughts.
